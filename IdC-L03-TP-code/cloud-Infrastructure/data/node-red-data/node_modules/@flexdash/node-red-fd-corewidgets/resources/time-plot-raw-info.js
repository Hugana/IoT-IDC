Null values are OK\nto designate missing data. Note: each and every data point must have one value per series.\n\nEach data message may be either an array of data points or a single data point. If an array is\nprovided then it replaces the entire dataset being shown. If a single point is provided\nit is appended to the current dataset and an old data point may be rotated out.\nNote that this \"row-wise\" structure gets transposed to the columnar structure expected by uPlot.\n\nThe `max_points` prop can be used to limit the number of data points to keep when\nsending data points incrementally.\nIf it is an integer it is interpreted as the number of points to keep.\nIf it is a string of the form `[0-9]*[smhd]` it is interpreted as a period of time\nin seconds, minutes, hours, or days. E.g. \"2h\" means keep the last 2 hours of data.\nThere is an additional hard-coded limit of 10k data points.\n",
